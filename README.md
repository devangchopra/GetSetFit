further on getting more time we could scale it at as many items as we want and could give sufficient time to train our model.  
What it does is :- In this application user is just required to scan their food and upload it . After that the trained machine learning model will predict the food item and will provide you the calories,protein ,carbohydrates,fats,fibre of that food item and will maintain your chart for whole day.
